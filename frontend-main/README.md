# Frontend

This projects froms the *frontend for the backend*: The whole backend is centered arround the mobile application for GIBZ targeting both major mobile platforms iOS and Android. This smartphone application could (should) be considered as the primary frontend since the sole need of the backend is to provide relevant data and services for the mobile application.

This *Frontend* project is the *maintenance area* where configuration and data driving the backend (and therefore the mobile application as well) is managed. There are multiple decoupled services for managing, storing and providing data forming the actual backend. Some of these services may be accessed through this single, united *Frontend* project.
